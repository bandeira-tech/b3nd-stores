/**
 * Entity schema types.
 *
 * `b3nd-save` ships two store interfaces:
 *
 * - `Store` — byte-only. Every backend in this package implements it.
 * - `EntityStore` (see `./entity-store.ts`) — schema-aware: every
 *   operation takes the `EntitySchema` it targets, so a single store
 *   instance can host many entities side-by-side. Schema is per-call,
 *   not pinned at construction.
 *
 * Entities are a client-layer concern. Clients map their wire payload
 * (`Output<T>`) into `EntityRecord`s and call the store with an
 * explicit schema; the store organises the medium accordingly
 * (separate Postgres tables, separate Mongo collections, separate
 * in-memory record maps). The schema travels with the data: there is
 * no implicit "current entity" inside the store.
 *
 * ## Open type vocabulary
 *
 * `EntityField.type` is `string[]`. The strings this package knows
 * about live in {@link TYPE_TAGS}, but the field type itself is
 * intentionally not a literal union — entities are shared across
 * protocols and custom stores, and one protocol's `"money"` or
 * `"geo"` tag should travel unchanged through stores that don't
 * recognise it. A field may carry multiple tags (e.g.
 * `["string", "email"]`) — they are refinements, not a value-type
 * union. A store consults the tags it knows to decide how to
 * materialise the field, and reports any field whose tags it cannot
 * make sense of as unsupported.
 *
 * ## Coercion vs. error reporting
 *
 * The store is strict: anything that doesn't fit the schema becomes
 * an error result so the rig wiring can be fixed. Coercion and field
 * projection are the client's job — `SaveClient` in its default
 * `BYTES_ENTITY` mode builds a `{ payload: bytes }` record from
 * incoming bytes; in record mode it passes records through verbatim.
 * If a record arrives with extra or mistyped fields, the store
 * reports the error rather than silently dropping data.
 */

/**
 * Canonical type tags published by this package.
 *
 * Stores in `b3nd-save` recognise these tags. Other protocols and
 * custom stores may freely add their own; `EntityField.type` stays
 * `string[]` so unknown tags pass through intact.
