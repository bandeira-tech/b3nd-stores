/**
 * @module
 * b3nd-save — the data-saving layer for b3nd.
 *
 * This root barrel re-exports every public subpath as a namespace.
 * Use it for convenience or discoverability; for the smallest
 * footprint, import the subpaths directly (e.g.
 * `@bandeira-tech/b3nd-save/postgres`).
 *
 * Namespaces:
 *   clients       — Store → ProtocolInterfaceNode adapters
 *   memory        — In-memory reference backend
 *   postgres, mongo, sqlite, fs, ipfs, s3, elasticsearch,
 *   localstorage, indexeddb — Backend implementations
 *
 * Store types (`Store`, `StoreEntry`, ...) are re-exported from the
 * root. `Store` is local to this package — clients are the bridge to
 * the rest of b3nd.
