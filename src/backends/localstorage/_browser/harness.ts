/**
 * Browser entry point for the LocalStorageStore real-browser test
 * harness. Bundled by `localstorage/integration.test.ts` via the

 *
 * First import wires up `globalThis.Deno.test` collection. The
 * shared store suite then registers tests against the real browser
 * `localStorage`. Each test creates a new LocalStorageStore with a
 * unique keyPrefix so the shared origin's storage doesn't leak
 * state between tests.
