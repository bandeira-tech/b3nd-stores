/**
 * Filesystem backend for b3nd.

 * Store implementation backed by the local filesystem. Requires an
 * injected FsExecutor so the package does not depend on a specific
 * filesystem API. Files hold raw payload bytes — the store is opaque.

 * The executor reads via `ReadableStream<Uint8Array>` to avoid forcing
 * callers (or the executor) to materialize large files in memory.
 * Writes accept the `StorePayload` union so existing buffered callers
 * still work without conversion.
